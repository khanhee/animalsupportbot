Many think the idea of veganism is too restrictive. The reality is that people around the world have the choice to enjoy animal-free foods that typically contain animals. There is a substitution or alternative for just about every animal product, from meats to milks to chocolate. Pizza, pasta, mac & cheese, curry, doughnuts, ice cream, and sushi are just a shortlist of the many foods that are available in vegan varieties worldwide. Beyond, Impossible, Lightlife, Quorn, and many others make a variety of beef alternatives including burgers that would be indistinguishable to die hard burger lovers. 

Most vegans usually end up eating a wider array of foods than their animal eating counterparts. Most people get into routines of eating what they always have and venture little into the foreign flavours of tempeh to Ethiopian food. Going vegan however, nudges you toward trying new ingredients like edamame, hericium, TVP, and taro. It encourages mixing and matching to create dishes like crispy lotus root topped spicy miso ramen, pasta salads with a rainbow's worth of veggie variety, and chilis with more types of beans that most people think exist. If you avoid spending time worrying about the foods you should not eat and are open minded about finding new and exciting foods, anyone would find veganism to be the opposite of restrictive.
